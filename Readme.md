# R scripts and data to perform multispecies occupancy model for two or more interacting species of Rota et al., 2016 (Methods in Ecology and Evolution)

This repo will demonstrate to load and run the model. The codes are annotated for readability.

For convenience and to remove clutter, the data have been cleaned but for safety reasons (because the study species are globally endangered) we do not provide GPS locations. 

Data includes detection histories of tiger, leopard and dhole.

Total number of sites = 849

Total site covariates = 5 (settlement, forest, sambar deer, gaur, serow)

Total detection covariates = 2 (Trail and Disturb)

Details: 
1. settlement density (per cent within 4 km circular radius of camera trap location)
2. Forest cover (per cent cover within 4 km radius of camera trap location)
Relative abundance of 3) sambar deer (Rusa unicolor); 4) gaur (Bod gaurus), and 5) serow (Capricornis thar)

Trail = coded 1/0 for camera traps placed on-trail or off-trail.
Disturb = daily detection rates of humans, livestock and domestic dogs at each camera station.
