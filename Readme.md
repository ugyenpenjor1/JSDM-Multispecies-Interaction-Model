# R scripts and data to perform multispecies occupancy model for two or more interacting species of Rota et al., 2016 (Methods in Ecology and Evolution)

This repo will demonstrate to load and run the model. The codes are annotated for readability.

For convenience and to remove clutter, the data have been cleaned but for safety reasons (because the study species are globally endangered) we do not provide GPS locations. 

Data include detection histories of tiger, leopard and dhole.

Total number of sites = 849

Total number of site covariates = 5 (settlement, forest, sambar deer, gaur, serow)

Total number of detection covariates = 2 (Trail and Disturb)

Details: 
1. settlement density (within a 4 km circular radius of camera trap location)
2. Forest cover (per cent cover within a 4 km radius of camera trap location)
Relative abundance of 3) sambar deer (Rusa unicolor); 4) gaur (Bos gaurus), and 5) serow (Capricornis thar)

Trail = (binary) coded 1/0 for camera traps placed on- or off-trail.
Disturb = daily encounter rates of humans, livestock and domestic dogs at each camera station.
